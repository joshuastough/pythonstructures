    "This notebook is meant to be a short and incomplete review of elements of the Python programming language. More depth on particular aspects is provided in linked notebooks. However, if you are not at all familiar with programming or algorithm development, I encourage you to first learn [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html#). For at least as good quick and dirty reviews of Python, check out [LearnPython](https://www.learnpython.org/) or [LearnByExample](https://www.learnbyexample.org/python-introduction/).\n",

    "## Six Elements of Programming Languages\n",
    "1. [**Variables**](#variables): You can assign a name to a specific data object. The data object is further an instance of a concept or *data type*. `x` and `y` could variables representing specific numbers.\n",
    "1. [**Expressions**](#expressions): In its simplest form, you can combine variables through *operators*. For example, `x + y` is the addition of the variables `x` and `y`. The word \"expression\" here is doing some pretty heavy lifting however: any bit of code that evaluates to a specific data object (with associated type) can be thought of as an expression: e.g, the above expression `x + y` evaluates to another number that is specific given the values of `x` and `y` at the moment of evaluation.\n",
    "1. [**Conditionals**](#condtitionals): You can change the thread of execution based on the current state of execution. `if` `x < y`, then do one thing, or `else` do something else. `x < y` is a *conditional expression* (evaluating to `True` or `False`), and `if/else` are keywords that separate the threads of execution represented by doing \"one thing\" or \"something else.\" \n",
    "1. [**Loops and Iteration**](#loops): You can repeat some subprocess either a fixed number of times or until some condition is met.\n",
    "1. [**Functional Abstraction**](#functions): You can assign a name to a specific process. In `def f(x,y)`, `f` is the name of a function that accepts `x` and `y` as parameters. Whatever sequence of devious things are done to `x` and `y`, we have assigned that sequence the name `f`, both for ease of use and to allow us to contruct even more complicated functions that make use of `f`.  Also `f(x,y)` can be called an *expression* that evaluates to whatever the function `f` returns.\n",
    "1. [**Data Abstraction**](#objects): You can define new concepts/data types that are composites of those already available. For example, we can define a `pair` of numbers `(x, y)` as the composite of `x` and `y`. For example a rectange could be such a composite of a height `h` and a width `w`. With these new data types defined, you can make all the other elements of the programming language more powerful (i.e., object methods that might compute the area or perimeter of such a rectangle, or add two rectangles together).

    "- Note that `type` is actually the name of a [function](#functions) that returns the type of the argument sent in, and `print` is the name of a function that prints out the value of the argument sent in.\n",
    "- Immutablity: objects of the types above *cannot be modified*. Think of it: if you add 1 to a number, you have a *different* number; if you try to change one character of a string, you have a *different* string. Note that reassigning a variable name, as in the statement `x = 1 + x`, is completely consistent with this immutability: the expression on the right of `=` is evaluated before the reassignment of the variable name on the left. For more, please see [here](1_variables_types_state.ipynb). \n",
    "- The `str`/string type can actually be thought of as an ordered sequence of characters. This type is thus not particularly \"atomic,\" in the sense of being inseparable, in the same way that a number or a truth value are. Still, because Python does not include an individual character type, it is useful to group `str` with the other atomic types above.

    "There are four principal operations for interacting with and manipulating any collection of stuff, that we will call the ***F.A.R.M ops: find, add, remove, modify***.

This is perhaps more of a derivative operation, in that it can be acheived through a composite find->remove->add. This is also commonly referred to as \"update.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "- [`list`](2_lists.ipynb): an ordered sequence of elements, where each element can be of any type. Elements can be accessed and manipulated through numerical indexing. For more on the `list` type, see [here](2_lists.ipynb) or the link at the beginning of this bullet.\n",
    "- [`dict`](2_dicts.ipynb): also called a dictionary, or associative array. This structure represents a collection of `key:value` pairs where no two `key`s are the same within a particular dictionary (instance). Values within the `dict` can be accessed and manipulated through the associated key. For more on the `dict` type, see [here](2_dicts.ipynb).\n",
    "- [`tuple`](2_tuples.ipynb): very much like a list, except that the elements in a tuple cannot be changed once you have made the tuple (immutability). See the link at the beginning of this list item.\n",

    "- `y` or `ll`: expressions consisting of a single variable (identifier).\n",

    "- `ll[3]` or `d[17]`: expressions that access elements of collections using the subscription operator `[]`. We'll see later these are actually also functional expressions, e.g. `ll.__getitem__(3)` in the first case. \n",
    "- `print(s)` or `ll.append(2020)`: expression *statements*, which usually *do* something through a procedure call/function (e.g., print a value, change a `list`), but *do not* evaluate to anything meaningful. Both examples here in fact return/evaluate to `None`, which we will see later. The thing that such expressions or statements do are called a *side effects*.\n",

These operators allow us to combine many of the expression types above to do more and more complicated things.

But to do it ourselves let's note a couple of things:\n",
    "- If a number is odd its right-most bit must be `1`. This makes sense because the only power of two that is odd is $2^0$, and in binary we're representing a number as a sum of the powers of two. \n",
    "- In decimal when you divide by ten you have the same digit sequence, but the right-most digit is lost (e.g.: note that `328//10` is `32`). Similarly if we divide a number by two, the result's binary representation is the same digit sequence except lost, right-most bit: e.g. $1101 (13_{10}) // 2 = 110(6_{10})$  \n",

    "Python has many [special method names](https://docs.python.org/3.8/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names) that you can choose to define for your classes (e.g., the \"less than\" operator). You can also define what [arithmetic on your objects](https://docs.python.org/3.8/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-numeric-types) means through method definitions like `__add__` above.\n",
    "- I chose for `r < s` to mean \"Is the area of `r` less than the area of `s`.\" Since the areas are numbers, Python already knew how to compare those.\n",
    "- `r + s` evaluates to a new `Rectangle` object whose area is the sum of the two rectangles' areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "The definitions of `__lt__` and `__add__` here were completely arbitrary for this example. When you attempt to simulate rectangles for your own purposes in computer programs, you can define for yourself what these operators should mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that none of the methods we defined will change `self.height` or `self.width`. The result is that our rectangle are immutable (like `int`, `float`, `str`, ...) in that they cannot change once they've been instantiated. \n",
