    "## Six Elements of Programming Languages\n",
    "1. [**Variables**](#variables): You can assign a name to a specific data object. The data object is further an instance of a concept or *data type*. `x` and `y` are variables representing specific numbers.\n",
    "1. [**Expressions**](#expressions): In its simplest form, you can combine variables through *operators*. For example, `x + y` is the addition of the variables `x` and `y`. The word \"expression\" here is doing some pretty heavy lifting however: any bit of code that evaluates to a specific data object (with associated type) can be thought of as an expression: e.g, the above expression `x + y` evaluates to another number that is specific given the values of `x` and `y` at the moment of evaluation.\n",
    "1. [**Conditionals**](#condtitionals): You can change the thread of execution based on the current state of execution. `if` `x < y`, then do one thing, or `else` do something else. `x < y` is a *conditional expression*, and `if/else` are keywords that separate the threads of execution represented by doing \"one thing\" or \"something else.\" \n",
    "1. [**Loops**](#loops): You can repeat some subprocess either a fixed number of times or until some condition is met.\n",
    "1. [**Functional Abstraction**](#functions): You can assign a name to a specific process. In `def f(x,y)`, `f` is the name of a function that accepts `x` and `y` as parameters. Whatever sequence of devious things are done to `x` and `y`, we have assigned that sequence the name `f`, both for ease of use and to allow us to contruct even more complicated functions that make use of `f`.  Also `f(x,y)` can be called an *expression* that evaluates to whatever the function `f` returns.\n",
    "1. [**Data Abstraction**](#objects): You can define new concepts/data types that are composites of those already available. For example, we can define a `pair` of numbers `(x, y)` as the composite of `x` and `y`. With these new data types defined, you can make all the other elements of the programming language more powerful."

    "From the above cells we see `x` has `int`/integer type, while `s` has `str`/string type. Several things to note about the above few cells:\n",
    "- In one of the cells, I have added a *comment*, `#<text>`. Anything coming after a `#` on a line is not interpretted by the Python kernel. \n",
    "- Note that `type` is actually the name of a [function](#functions) that returns the type of the argument sent in, and `print` is the name of a function that prints out the value of the argument sent in.\n",
    "- Immutablity: objects of the types above *cannot be modified*. Think of it: if you add 1 to a number, you have a *different* number; if you try to change one character of a string, you have a *different* string. Reassigning a variable name, as in the statement `x = 1 + x`, is completely consistent with this immutability. For more, please see [here](1_variables_types_state.ipynb). \n",
    "- The `str`/string type can actually be thought of as an ordered sequence of characters. This type is thus not particularly \"atomic,\" in the sense of being inseparable, in the same way that a number or a truth value are. Still, because Python does not include an individual character type, it is useful to group `str` with the other atomic types above. For much more on the `str` type and string processing capability of Python, see [here](2_strings.ipynb)."
