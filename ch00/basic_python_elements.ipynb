    "Most [useful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) programming languages offer formal syntax for *six* elements of algorithms. With just these six elements, you can exactly define for the computer any process.\n",

    "## Six Elements of Programming Languages\n",
    "1. [**Variables**](#variables): You can assign a name to a specific instance of a concept, or data type. `x` and `y` are variables representing specific numbers.\n",
    "1. [**Expressions**](#expressions): You can combine variables through operators. `x + y` is the addition of the variables `x` and `y`.\n",
    "1. [**Conditionals**](#condtitionals): You can change the thread of execution based on the current state of execution. `if` `x < y`, then do one thing, or `else` do something else. `x < y` is a *conditional expression*, and `if/else` are keywords that separate the threads of execution represented by doing \"one thing\" or \"something else.\" \n",
    "1. [**Loops**](#loops): You can repeat some subprocess either a fixed number of times or until some condition is met.\n",
    "1. [**Functional Abstraction**](#functions): You can assign a name to a specific process. In `def f(x,y)`, `f` is the name of a function that accepts `x` and `y` as parameters. Whatever sequence of devious things are done to `x` and `y`, we have assigned that sequence the name `f`, both for ease of use and to allow us to contruct even more complicated functions that make use of `f`.  Also `f(x,y)` can be called an *expression* that evaluates to whatever the function `f` returns.\n",
    "1. [**Data Abstraction**](#objects): You can define new concepts/data types that are composites of those already available. For example, we can define a `pair` of numbers `(x, y)` as the composite of `x` and `y`. With these new data types defined, you can make all the other elements of the programming language more powerful."
